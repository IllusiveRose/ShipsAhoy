    //The portrait sheet can have any number of expressions, but must only be two expressions wide (A sheet of 10 expressions would consist of 5 rows and 2 columns)
    //Each expression is 64 pixels x 64 pixels
    //As long as the PNG is named after the original Stardew NPC, no code required. (i.e, the portrait sheet with all of Luffy's expressions is still called Sebastian.PNG.
    //Alternatively, if you want the portrait sheets to have One Piece names, use the below code:

    //NPC Gift Tastes: see https://github.com/Pathoschild/StardewMods/blob/develop/ContentPatcher/docs/author-guide/text-operations.md
    //To swap entire list:
    //{
     // "Action": "EditData",
      //"Target": "Data/NPCGiftTastes",
      //"Entries": {
        //"Universal_Love": "74 446 797 373 279 127 128" // replaces current value
      //}
   // },
    //This is pretty simple, but unfortunately it overwrites any previous values. 
    //That will remove any changes from other mods or in future game updates. 
    // So instead, we can use the Append operation to add new gift tastes without changing the other values: 

   // {
     // "Action": "EditData",
     // "Target": "Data/NPCGiftTastes",
     // "TextOperations": [
      //  {
       //   "Operation": "Append",
         // "Target": [ "Entries", "Universal_Love" ],
         // "Value": "127 128",
         // "Delimiter": " " // if the field isn't empty, add a space between the old & new text
       // }
    //  ]
   // }

    //Engagement Dialogue
